//Primitive Data Types

// //String - Sequence of characters
 const firstName = 'Sara';

let output = firstName;

console.log(output, typeof output);
// Number - Integers as well as floating point numbers
const age = 30;

output = age;

console.log(output, typeof output);
// Boolean - Logical entity - true or false
// Null - Intentional absence of any object value
// Undefined - A Variable that has not yet been defined / assigned
// Symbol - Built-in object whose constructor returns a unique symbol
// BigInt - Numbers that are greater than the "Number" type can handle

// Reference types or "objects" are a non-primitive value -- the
// variable is given a reference to that value
